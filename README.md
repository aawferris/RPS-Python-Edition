# RPS-Python-Edition
This is my first project in Python.  I started learning the basics last week on W3 Schools in preparation for the course 
I will teach next year (Intro to Computer Science).  I followed along with a tutorial found at:
https://realpython.com/python-rock-paper-scissors/#the-flowchart-of-your-program

This was a great experience as it walked through two iterations of DRYing out the code.  
The first iteration was the code as one would expect to write it.  In the next iterations,
we cleaned up the code more and made it more dynamic.  You'll see examples of getting user input and
handling edge cases in user input.

I also got more familiar with the Python syntax for declaring funtions and calling them.
Compared to JS, Java, and Ruby - it seems like the logic is the same but its expression is
much more akin to everyday English; which I certainly enjoy!
